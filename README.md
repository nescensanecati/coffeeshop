# Coffee-Site Website
Coffee-Site is a Brainstation bootcamp project, these project took two weeks (one week counted as a sprint during the bootcamp)

Week two of the bootcamp was when the website was completed and the site was delivered for a final evaluation. 

Two weeks into the bootcamp, it was time to be more involved into using HTML and SCSS (no React, no JS, no reactive websites, or client/server structure).
