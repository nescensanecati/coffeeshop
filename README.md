# Coffee-Site Website
Coffee-Site is a Brainstation bootcamp project, this project took two weeks (one week counted as a sprint during the bootcamp)

Week two of the bootcamp was when the website was completed and the site was delivered for a final evaluation. 

Two weeks into the bootcamp, it was time to be more involved into using HTML and SCSS (no React, no JS, no reactive websites, or client/server structure). 

This site is sized to be consumed at 1280 pixels, every other screen size might cause very noticeable formatting issues.
